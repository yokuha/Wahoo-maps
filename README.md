# Wahoo-maps

Documentation and personal adaptations of homebuilt Wahoo maps and themes.

In this project, I'll try to provide a consistent, hopefully easily accessible,
documentation of the installation of updated maps for Wahoo Roam and Bolt GPS
cycling computers. This discussion is focused on, and often limited to, the Bolt
v2 and Roam v2 computers, which I will jointly refer to as ``Wahoo'' in this
documentation.

This is really a very simple and small project standing on the shoulders of
Giants, or even more so, simply trying to provide a single-stop documentation
for newbies. Any feedback and help in that respect is very welcome.



# Improving the maps on Wahoo bike computers

The easiest update to implement is to use an updated render theme, as the on
contained in this project. This can be done by copying the files from
[render-theme/] to your Wahoo:
* connect the Wahoo to the computer _via_ USB and turn it on
* create `maps/vtm-elemnt`, for instance, using [Android File transfer]
* copy the content of (render-theme/) on your computer to `maps/vtm-elemnt` on
  the Wahoo.
