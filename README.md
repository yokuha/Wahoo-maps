# Wahoo-maps

Documentation and personal adaptations of homebuilt Wahoo maps and themes.

In this project, I'll try to provide a consistent, hopefully low-entrance key,
documentation of the installation of updated maps for Wahoo Roam and Bolt GPS
cycling computers.

This is really a very simple and small project standing on the shoulders of
Giants, or even more so, simply trying to provide a single-stop documentation
for newbies. Any feedback and help in that respect is very welcome.
